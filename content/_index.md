# **Welcome to the Quilted Tutorials**
We will be demonstrating different features from the [**SPARC**](https://sparc.science/) project. The goal will be to project the 2D locations of neurites in the rat stomach onto a 3D scaffhold of the organ. The data points and the 3D scaffhold will be pulled from **SPARC** datasets. Because the data is [**FAIR**](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) we will be combining three different datasets of the spatial distribution of the vagal afferents and efferents. 

This is an online hub that is populated with Quilted Tutorials to showcase how tools within the **SPARC** ecosystem can be combined to achieve unified workflows. Each tutorial is contained within an individual Jupyter Notebook.

You can find out more about the **SPARC** project and **FAIR** data in the [About]({{< ref "About" >}} "About") page. If you already know all about it, then head to the [Getting started]({{< ref "Getting_started" >}} "Getting_started") page to get your hands dirty!
