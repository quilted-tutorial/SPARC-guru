The **S**timulating **P**eripheral **A**ctivity to **R**elieve **C**onditions ([**SPARC**](https://sparc.science/about)) program is supported by the NIH Common Fund to provide a scientific and technological foundation for future bioelectronic medicine devices and protocols. The initiative is made up of over ***60*** research teams scattered around the globe, all working together on a common objective. The entire project is **Open Source** and follows the **F**indable, **A**ccessible, **I**nteroperable, and **R**eusable ([**FAIR**](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618)) guidelines for data management.

In 2021, the amazing team of the **D**ata and **R**esource **C**enter ([**DRC**](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34248680/)) organised a [**Codeathon**](https://sparc.science/help/2021-sparc-fair-codeathon) to improve various elements of the **SPARC** program. In 2022, they've done it [again](https://sparc.science/help/2022-sparc-fair-codeathon)! This website is a submission for the 2022 SPARC FAIR Codeathon.

Congratulations! You are all caught up on the basics of **SPARC** and **FAIR** data. It is now time to have some fun and finally begin your journey towards the title of **SPARC** Guru by diving into the [Quilted Tutorials]({{< ref "Getting_started" >}} "Getting_started")!
